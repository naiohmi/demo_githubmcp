## Getting Started for New Developers

### What is MCP?
Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized way for different parts of a system to communicate. In our case, it helps us talk to GitHub's API in a consistent and reliable way. Think of it like a translator that helps our code communicate with GitHub.

### System Architecture Explained
Let's break down how our system works in simple terms:

        B --> C[Tools Layer<br/>(The Toolkit)]
        C --> D[Client Layer<br/>(The Messenger)]
        D --> E[MCP Server<br/>(The Translator)]
        E --> F[GitHub API]
    end

```

1. **MCP Server (The Translator)**
   - This is like a translator that understands both our code and GitHub
   - Handles all direct communication with GitHub
   - Makes sure we don't exceed GitHub's limits

2. **Client Layer (The Messenger)**
   - This is how our code talks to the translator (MCP Server)
   - Manages connections and handles basic errors
   - Like sending and receiving messages through a mailbox

3. **Tools Layer (The Toolkit)**
   - A collection of specific tools for GitHub tasks
   - Each tool does one specific job (like getting repository info)
   - Makes complex GitHub operations simple to use

4. **Service Layer (The Manager)**
   - Coordinates different tools to accomplish tasks
   - Handles high-level operations
   - Makes everything work together smoothly

### Your First Steps

1. **Setting Up**
   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone <repository-url>
   
   # Install dependencies
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
   # Set up your GitHub token
   export GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token
   ```

2. **Basic Example: Getting Repository Info**
   ```python
   # This is the simplest way to use our system
   from src.services.github_service import get_github_service
   
   async def my_first_github_operation():
       # Get the service (it handles all the complex setup)
       service = await get_github_service()
       
       # Get info about a repository (it's that simple!)
       repo_info = await service.get_repository_info(
           owner="microsoft",
           repo="vscode"
       )
       print(repo_info)
   ```

### Common Tasks with Examples

1. **Working with Repositories**
   ```python
   async def repository_examples():
       service = await get_github_service()
       
       # Get repository details
       repo_info = await service.get_repository_info(
           owner="username",
           repo="repository"
       )
       
       # Get repository branches
       branches = await service.get_repository_branches(
           owner="username",
           repo="repository"
       )
   ```

2. **Working with Pull Requests**
   ```python
   async def pr_examples():
       service = await get_github_service()
       
       # List recent PRs
       prs = await service.get_latest_pull_requests(
           owner="username",
           repo="repository",
           limit=5  # Get 5 most recent PRs
       )
   ```

### Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Common Issues and Solutions**
   - `Token not found`: Make sure you've set your GitHub token
   - `Connection failed`: Check your internet connection
   - `Rate limit exceeded`: You're making too many requests too quickly

2. **Debug Checklist**
   - Is your GitHub token set correctly?
   - Are you using `async/await` correctly?
   - Are the repository owner and name correct?
   - Do you have the right permissions?

### Best Practices for Beginners

1. **Code Organization**
   - Always use context managers (`async with`)
   - Handle errors appropriately
   - Clean up resources properly

2. **Performance**
   - Reuse service instances when possible
   - Don't make unnecessary API calls
   - Use batch operations when available

## Core Components

1. **MCP Server**
   - Handles GitHub API communication
   - Manages authentication and rate limiting
   - Provides standardized tool interfaces

2. **Client Layer**
   - Manages server communication
   - Handles process lifecycle
   - Implements error handling

3. **Tools Layer**
   - Provides specific GitHub operations
   - Implements input validation
   - Standardizes tool interfaces

4. **Service Layer**
   - High-level operation coordination
   - Session and context management
   - Agent-based interactions
